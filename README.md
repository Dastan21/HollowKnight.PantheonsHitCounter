# HollowKnight.PantheonsHitCounter

PantheonsHitCounter is a Hollow Knight mod which adds an in-game interface to count hits in the pantheons of Godhome.

This mod is automated, so you don't have to press keys to switch bosses or add hits. However, you can still switch bosses manually with keys (bindeable in the mod menu).

Note: If Grey Prince Zote isn't unlocked, it will not appear in the list.
